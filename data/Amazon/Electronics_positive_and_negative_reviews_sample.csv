3,Works but corners crack,"Works well, but the corner of the plastic cracked and is broken after a month or so. I think at least 2 of the plastic corners are cracked now. still works but wish it was higher quality."
3,"Decent, but the design is flawed.",Somewhat disappointed. Works as advertised except this desk is not wide enough and therefore your computer is not centered for typing. I’m order to do my homework I have to set it up as shown in my photo (move computer to center of desk instead of where it’s supposed to sit) which leaves little room for my mouse to be used. This is the only flaw I am seeing so far.
3,Bad standby life,These batteries during use have a good life. Standby life is poor. They discharge in 7/10 days of standby. For a recreational photographer this limiting.
3,You get what you pay for I guess.,"I'm giving it three stars because, although the case and keyboard cover are good (I really like those), the sleeve has already started ripping. I haven't even had this for a week. It's kind of disappointing actually. I love the colors of the case and keyboard cover though! But for the sake of the sleeve, which I thought was essential, I have to give it a sleeve."
3,"Feels better than stock to me, and the sweat doesn't absorb into leather.","Positives:<br />1. Sweat cleans off easy, not hard to install and the included eye cover is functional. I find it works better with my frankenquest adapters at holding things in place than the stock foam. It bounces on my face less ands doesn't require as much tension.<br />2. This does seem to work better at keeping my face cool that just the silicone covers for the stock foam.<br />Negatives:<br />1. There is still a bit of light bleed out the sides, but it's not bad unless you are in a really bright room and you can only tell in dark scenes. I have seen other adapters including side cushions to repair this issue.<br />2. The nose piece doesn't stay on well, and when it does it presses hard and leaves a mark on my nose. It's still rubber so it's not painful, but there has to be a better solution. Maybe cut it lower or make it a bit more flexible. If you remove it there is a lot of open area in your lower vision.<br /><br />Overall I recommend it over a silicone cover for the stock foam, but it has a lot of downfalls so I am sure this isn't the best option for a new face plate."
3,"Definitely not for me, but maybe for my sons","First for pros: This is tiny, maybe about 3/4 inch thick at it's widest. Sleek, attractive and would probably delight any techie who is looking for some kind of new hip gadget. For the cons: It's too small. There are no indentations to grip the mouse and it is difficult to click on any area that you are trying to. Navigation/movement of the mouse is ok, it's the clicking that is difficult to do (and it becomes quite annoying to say the least). Within using this for a full day I, unfortunately, reverted back to my old wireless HP mouse. Maybe I am just old school and set in my ways (I am in my 50's), so I will be 'loaning' this to my techie son to give it a go. Maybe he will appreciate this better and will be able to navigate easier than I could. If that is the case, I will revisit my review and update accordingly."
3,Wait for a Gold Box special before ordering,"I am a little disappointed with the quality of this point and shoot. First, the pros are that it is light, attractive, small and easy to carry. Everything else, in my opinion, really revolves around what you get for the money. Quality of the pictures is just ok, I honestly think my Apple iphone takes better pictures (even in dimly lit areas). But for those people who want to take a lot of pictures on a trip and need memory card, then a camera would be a must have. Not crazy about the zoom capability, seems to definitely be less than advertised. As I mentioned, in low lighting camera stabilization seems low. Overall, if this was in a gold box deal for $99 I would jump on it for the name and durability of a Sony product. But not for $20-30 more than that. I think you can do better."
5,Excellent!,"I love these. They even come with a carry case and several sizes of ear bud inserts. Thank heaven!  I get ear pain from most, but the smallest buds fit great.  They also have a charger and all of it fits in the carry case. I just wish they came in more colors preferably something bright!  When I leave them on my nightstand it takes a while to figure out which of half a dozen black cables are the right ones. Even white would be ok as only my iPhone has a white cord."
4,Worthy Purchase!,"Arrived sooner than the original really long estimated date.  Packaged well.  Remote wall bracket included.  No ceiling or wall mounting hardware included for the screen.  Very quiet operation. Moves very slowly up/down, but no big problem as the projector is usually getting up to temperature.  High vinyl odor, but that's fading, since installed 4 days ago. Does hide-away nicely and seems unobtrusive.  Worthy purchase."
5,Easy connect,A little crackly at times but not that noticeable. Just turn the volume up. Easy connect. Use everyday
4,Great Buds for use in an office or other similar locations.,"These are great inexpensive ear buds.  My only complaint would be  lack of bass in the music.  Other than that, these are a good low-cost selection for some wireless buds.  I use mine every day at work."
5,awesome colors,can change for any holiday or time of year. holding up and fit nice. sime issues with them coming undone but not with all of them.
4,Make sure to leave room for sag....,"I installed this in the back of a built in. Had 24"" to clear and it did fine, but it sages down about 1.5 inches and I wasnt expecting that much. I left that much clearance luckily, so it barely rubs, but it can block the IR since I have a sound bar wall mounted also.<br />TV only weighs about 25 lbs so I have no idea how bad it would be if you used the max capacity of 60lb.<br />If it didn't sag so bad it would be 5 stars though. Easy install and works well, feels solid."
5,"High quality, solid connections",Great bright white color and solid connections. The combs are very difficult to install but it's worth it for those truly clean aesthetics.
4,"Nice card, a bit loud when fans are maxed",Beautiful card. Runs well and seems solid. My only complaint is when it winds up to full speed it's a bit loud and when it's at full load it gets hot with the stock fan curve. Stays below 60 when fans are blasting though.
4,Great gadget/gift for the person who has everything!,"Cute gadget. Gave it to my 28 year old son to try first (as I can sometimes be technically challenged). It was easy to set up an within minutes he was using it (to the delight of his 5 year old daughter). No complaints except for the battery life. Didn't seem like he used it for more than an hour that he had to recharge. I think Parrot should do something to extend on this if they expect to attract a sizeable crowd purchasing same. I will say that it would make a great gift to give the person who seems to have everything as it is clever and definitely a conversation piece. Holiday giving would work especially to be under the tree for the difficult to buy for sure. I would just keep in mind the battery life. As a closing comment, I am now the proud owner of this minidrone and I must admit this 50 something women just loves to play with it (to this dismay of my cat who would love to get her paws on this, lol)"
4,Nice cover for my Kindle,"Fits well, protects well and is an attractive cover for my 7"" Kindle. If there was any downside it's the smell. I hate that faux leather smell. I am thinking that over time, hopefully, it will lose the plastic/rubbery smell."
4,"Great camera for the money - good, solid features","I want to begin by saying I own a Canon Rebel which I love and use all the time. I wanted to get a second camera which also took great pictures but that was lower priced and better for me to take on extended travel without all my lenses). The Fujifilm FinePix is a good camera. For around the $200 price range, you get a high quality camera with good picture taking quality (14 MP, EVF, 30 times zoom capability). It is easy to learn and use and makes an excellent entry level camera with high quality features (would make a great graduation gift for a high schooler to introduce them to a higher level of picture taking than a simple point and shoot). It is a little large and plasticy, but overall I do recommend it for a good second camera or, as I mentioned, to someone looking to enter the SLR market (but not ready to spend $600+)."
4,Amazing sound - It's a Bose!,"First for the pros: Beautiful looking, sleek, shiny and artfully designed to fit any style room. Relatively easy to install (being a non-techy person I actually followed the verbal audio instructions easily and flawlessly). The wireless woofer is an asset with no ugly wires (as my previous Panasonic system had)and amazing (loud) bass tones. The sound is amazing (which I expected from Bose). The cons: I am having a difficult time using the remote control which is supposed to act as an all-in-one device (supposedly so I can get rid of all these little dedicated remotes I have for the DVD, television, cable, etc). For whatever reason, the device sticks frequently or doesn't respond to commands and I end up reverting back to the old standby remotes. I am disappointed that a company like Bose couldn't have perfected something like this better. But then I keep thinking, maybe I did something wrong, not sure. The only other con is the price. If this was in a $700-1000 range I would tell you to snatch it up in a heartbeat. But for $1500 you are honestly paying for the name (and the status symbol bragging rights to say you own a Bose system). Wait for the price to come down and grab it. You honestly won't be disappointed with the sound quality nor the set up (and, who knows, maybe it's me in not being able to get the remote to work properly with all my other devices)."
2,Definitely not an ipod,"Let me start by saying I got the Philip's Gogear as part of the Vine program. I have always used an Ipod, so this was new for me. I really had serious issues with using this device. First for the positives: it's an attractive size and the display is clear. On the downside, I found it difficult to navigate. I also experience, while running, the jostling of the settings (meaning that all of a sudden it skipped to the next song). I had a real problem with that, so I stopped using it. Figure I can give the device to a kid or someone who doesn't jog or require any kind of non-static device. So, I rated this two stars thinking that maybe someone who doesn't exercise and is simply listening to music might have a use for this, but I am returning to my Apple."
4,Probably great for a professional,"I was in the market for a new camera and when I saw this bag in the Vine program I thought I would snap it up. I did get my Canon Rebel (thanks Amazon!) and several lenses to boot (in preparation for my trip this month to Israel). Although the quality of the bag is good, the size to me is really inconvenient. First, it is shaped like a back pack, which makes it kind of big. I am not sure if I am going to be able to bring this on the plane with me (as the boarding guidelines state 1 carry-on and I have a purse and laptop I am bringing). In addition, there are straps and zippered compartments which are not really conveniently placed. It's not an easy bag to get your gear in and out of. I see this bag as a great tool to have if you are backpacking as you have a place to hang a tripod and there is a small storage area if you wanted to bring a snack with you. But for someone like me, who wants it for sightseeing/traveling, I think a more conventional camera bag would have done the trick better."
4,Nice case for the price,"I agree with most of the other reviews on here. The case is really quite nice, well made quality leather and fits the ipod snugly. Makes a beautiful, classy appearance to the eye. Only complaint is the fact that you have to remove the ipod from the case (which is not an easy task) every time you want to connect it to your computer. I haven't been as daring as everyone else in trying to 'doctor' up the case (by slicing through the leather) and don't think I will try it. I will use it as is."
3,The sound quality is good but the plastic part that goes around the ear ...,"It could just be my ear, but it felt as if it were going to fall off every time I moved my head.  The sound quality is good but the plastic part that goes around the ear hurts your head after a while."
